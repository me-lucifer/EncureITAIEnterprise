Subject: AI Governance & Security Practice - Strategic Plan

Hi [Manager],

I've prepared an interactive strategic plan for our AI Governance & Security practice:

🔗 View Plan: https://your-site.vercel.app

Key Highlights:
• Investment: ₹50 Lakhs
• Expected Revenue: ₹100-150L (Year 1)
• ROI: 207%
• Payback: 6-8 months

Use the left sidebar to navigate between sections.

Best regards,
