## The Opportunity

**Strategic Insight:** **AI is in its "baby phase" now, but the "maturity phase" is coming fast** (2026-2027). When large enterprises move from experimenting with AI to deploying it at scale, they will demand **governance and security expertise**. Companies that build this capability now will dominate the market.

**Market Size:** $15.8 billion by 2030 (30% annual growth)  
**Timing:** Perfect - EU AI Act enforcement starts August 2026, creating urgent compliance demand  
**Competition:** Low - Big consultancies focus on Fortune 500, leaving mid-market wide open  

---

## Our Strategy: Dual-Track Approach

### **Track A: Enterprise Partnerships** (Long-term, high-value)
Partner with the "Kingmakers" of AI governance to access their enterprise clients and earn commissions:

1. **Microsoft Purview** - Broadest market (every Office 365 customer needs this)
2. **IBM watsonx.governance** - Regulated industries (banking, healthcare)
3. **AWS Bedrock** - Cloud market leader
4. **Google Cloud** - Innovation edge

**Revenue Model:** License commissions (15-44%) + implementation fees (₹20-80L per project)

---

### **Track B: Independent Services** (Immediate revenue, high margin)
Build proprietary AI security services using open-source tools:

1. **AI Security Health Check** (₹4-8L one-time) - Vulnerability assessment
2. **RAG Pipeline Validation** (₹6-12L one-time) - Accuracy testing for AI chatbots
3. **AI Guardian Managed Service** (₹1.6-8L/month) - Continuous monitoring subscription
4. **Enterprise Implementations** (₹20-80L) - Deploy governance platforms
5. **Custom Tools Development** (₹40-120L) - Industry-specific solutions

**Revenue Model:** Mix of one-time projects (40%) and recurring subscriptions (60%)

## Risk Mitigation

### Key Risks & Mitigation

**Risk 2: Service Delivery Issues**
- **Mitigation:** Pause sales, fix processes, hire additional staff

**Risk 3: Partnership Not Delivering**
- **Mitigation:** Multi-vendor strategy (no single vendor >40% of revenue)

**Risk 4: Competitive Pressure**
- **Mitigation:** Build proprietary tools, specialize in mid-market niche
